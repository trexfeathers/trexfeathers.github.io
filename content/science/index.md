## ðŸ”¬ Science

My further and higher education were 100% focussed on science; my highest
qualification is a BSc in Evolutionary Biology from the University of Exeter.
The experience I gained at Exeter was enormously valuable, I felt fully
immersed in the discipline and had the opportunity to assist on a number of
projects, and this allowed me to see early on that a career outside academic
science would see me more fulfilled.
