## Academic work

Here are some summaries and downloads of the best work from my education.

### Higher Education (University of Exeter)

Unfortunately, due plagiarism rules, I am not allowed to publish my university
work online. Here I have posted the abstracts/summaries. But if you are
interested, and not an Exeter Biosciences student, then contact me personally
and I can send you a copy.

Honours Research Project: 'Stabilising sexual selection conflicts with
directional natural selection in the cricket _Gryllodes sigillatus_' - achieved
77%

> Conflict between natural and sexual selection has long been theorised, with
> some
> empirical support. When conflict was originally proposed, it was assumed that
> natural selection was stabilising and sexual selection directional, but this is
> often incorrect. Natural selection is more commonly directional, while signal
> traits associated with female choice are sometimes under stabilising selection.
> How conflict is altered under these different selection pressures is yet to be
> studied. Cuticular hydrocarbons have roles in both desiccation resistance and
> sexual signalling, and have demonstrated multivariate stabilising sexual
> selection in crickets, making cricket hydrocarbon profile ideal for a
> comparative study. Using multivariate selection analysis and canonical
> analysis,
> conflict was found between directional natural selection and stabilising sexual
> selection on male cuticular hydrocarbon profile in the cricket _Gryllodes
> sigillatus_. The same dynamics underlying the traditional conflict model can be
> applied to other forms of conflict like those observed here, although the
> specifics of this will need further investigation. The results and success of
> this study offer opportunities for further research, beginning with replication
> of this study in other species and other traits, such as male call structure.

Dissertation in Evolution: 'On the Phylogenetics of Cooperation' - achieved 67%

> Cooperation has been heavily studied in recent years, with many high profile
> papers speculating on the origin and maintenance of cooperation. Cooperative
> mechanisms are being increasingly found in all areas of life including
> microbes.
> This study looks to bring together many papers investigating the phylogenetics
> of cooperation, an area that has received less attention, in order to determine
> whether cooperation is typically an ancestral trait or if it is often the
> product of convergent evolution. Cooperation is found to typically be an
> ancestral trait, that has often been lost during the evolution of modern
> species. Further research is recommended into horizontal gene transfer and into
> primate phylogenies in relation to cooperation.

Evolutionary Genetics Experiment: 'Sexual selection in the crop pest _Tipula
paludosa_, with implications for Sterilised Insect Technique' - achieved 82%

> The larva of _Tipula paludosa_ is a crop pest, and knowledge of sexual
> selection
> in this species could aid in designing pest control methods. 6 traits were
> measured for selection in males captured autumn 2009 in Cornwall, using mating
> status at time of capture as a fitness correlate; co-variance between the
> traits
> was also measured. Weight was found to be the only trait significantly selected
> on, and of several proposed reasons for this, ability to pin females down and
> initiate mating was seen as the most likely explanation. The only significant
> co-variance found was between abdomen length and weight; it is proposed that
> this is because the abdomen is the most stable place to concentrate mass in a
> crane fly body. These findings can aid the design of a sterilised insect
> technique (SIT) method for population control, by increasing the abdomen length
> – and therefore weight – of the sterilised males released. Searching literature
> for possible explanations for the results highlighted a distinct lack of
> research into sexual selection in the Tipulidae, despite an obvious
> diversity in
> mechanisms from one species to the next. Further research in this area is
> strongly recommended.
