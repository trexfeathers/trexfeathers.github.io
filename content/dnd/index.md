## üêâ DnD

Here is a character sheet I made to help me cope with the complexity of
DnD character creation!

### Fun to roleplay

My DnD group aren't about min-maxing, or immersion; we just love to make each 
other laugh. A wizard debutant trapped in the body of a bear should do the 
trick! Although I went in a different direction, the original inspiration was
of course [Sir Bearington](https://rpgmuseum.fandom.com/wiki/Sir_Bearington).

### Open source

I love open source (see [Software Development](../software_development)), so 
I wanted to try making a character just using only the
[System Reference Document](https://www.dndbeyond.com/srd), which is 
released under the Creative Commons licence.

### Where did this come from?

Once you combine Class, Background, Race, and levelling up, a DnD character is
a complex mix of feats, dice rolls and other traits. It's always bugged me 
that I can't keep track of why my character is proficient in something, or 
how they ended up with this many spells in their spellbook. I'm guessing 
this isn't a problem for most people, but since it is for me I used 
Microsoft Word's cross-references to make something like a 'foot-note' to 
trace back to the original reason.

I also found that you can insert simple formulae into a Word document, so I 
used that to convert ability scores into modifiers, and record my levelling 
up hit-point rolls.

### Remembering all the options

A character can do a lot in one round, especially when there are bonus 
actions and reactions. So I've always found it helpful to list it all out, 
even the default actions like `disengage` or `ready`.

Having rolled up a Wizard there were also a lot of things to remember every 
Long Rest and every levelling up, so I'm glad to have a space to list those 
out too.
