## Why `trexfeathers`?

I originally wrote a website as a university project on the communication of
science. I wrote about the evolution of feathers, and how the evidence is rather
confusing. [You can view the original site here](original_site){:target="

One of the featured specimens was called _Dilong_, an ancestral tyrannosaur that
was covered in downy feathers. This suggests that other tyrannosaurs, including
the famous _T. rex_, could also have had feathers, so `trexfeathers` became the
website domain.

I later expanded the site to include anything about me, but I
kept `trexfeathers` as the domain and also as a unique online 'handle'. The site
initially used Joomla, then WordPress, but since becoming an avid GitHub user
I'm enjoying this minimalist low-maintenance GitHub Pages setup.
