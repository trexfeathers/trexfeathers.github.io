## üçï Pizza

I started making my own pizzas in 2010, from an online recipe. It was fun! 
But things got way better when I was given the 
[Pizza Pilgrims Book](https://harpercollins.co.uk/products/pizza-pilgrims-recipes-from-the-backstreets-of-italy-thom-elliot)
for Christmas in 2014. I had never even considered making the dough a whole day
before; a delicious improvement.

Thing is: chef quality pizza dough made in a wood fired oven doesn't always fit
with everyday life. I started with the Pilgrims' recipe, but it's constantly
evolving with what works best for me. Read on below...

### Dough

#### Equipment

- A mixing bowl/jug. For reviving the yeast.
- A large mixing bowl. For mixing the dough.
- A spatula. For mixing the dough.
- A clean surface. For kneading the dough.
- 8 small bowls, which must be slightly flexible. I recommend the plastic 
  bowls that are used for picnics and for children. For proving the dough.
- 8 small plates. To cover the bowls.
- 8 sandwich bags.

#### Ingredients

- 1kg white bread flour. 'Strong' flour is better, and Canadian even better - 
  more gluten - but neither of these are essential.
- 600ml lukewarm water.
- Half tablespoon of dried yeast. Not the fast action stuff unless you want 
  exploding dough.
- Half tablespoon of salt.
- Teaspoon of sugar.
- A small amount of oil. Any type will do. For greasing the proving bowls.

#### Method

##### Revive the yeast

Dissolve the sugar into 300ml of the lukewarm water. Add the yeast, then whisk
the mixture so that the yeast has some oxygen to work with. Cover the 
dish/jug/whatever with a tea towel.

##### Prepare the flour

Mix the flour and salt in a bowl, and clean a surface ready for kneading. Dust
the surface with flour.

##### Prepare the bowls for proving

Use the oil to grease the 8 bowls and 8 plates. Put them to the side.

##### Mix the dough

Hopefully by now the yeast has been resting for 10-15 minutes. Small bubbles
should have formed on the water surface - gas produced by the yeast. Pour in 
the remaining 300ml of water, then whisk the mixture again.

Pour the yeast mix into the flour, and roughly mix it all together using the 
spatula. Tip the roughly mixed dough onto the floured surface. Knead for 
15mins; doing this correctly is important for getting the gluten fibres 
stretched and aligned correctly, to produce elastic dough. Correct technique is 
much easier to understand visually - 
[here is a video](https://youtu.be/l9avZp3xFNU?si=K1J5fAkeyBMxmfNN) of the 
technique I currently use.

Leave the kneaded dough to relax for 10-15mins.

##### Prove the dough

Aggressively knead the dough for 15secs. Divide it into 8 - I recommend using
a knife to cut the ball into quarters, then balling up each quarter and cutting
those in half. Place each 8th into one of the oiled bowls, and cover with one
of the oiled plates. The oiled plate 'lid' avoids sticking even if the 
dough overflows the bowl while proving.

Leave the dough bowls in a warm place for around 12hrs. The liveliness of the
yeast can be very variable, so exactly how long will depend on how quickly the
dough proves. The longer the prove, the tastier the pizza base, but you'll 
need to stop the prove if the dough overflows the bowl.

(Many recipes recommend proving on a flat surface, giving the dough room to 
relax outwards. I find this only works with high gluten flour that has been 
kneaded expertly, otherwise the dough is not elastic enough and falls apart 
when you're trying to make a pizza. Proving in bowls seems to provide extra 
structure, allowing you to get away with lower quality preparation!)

##### Use or freeze the dough

Once the prove has finished, you can either use the dough right away - see 
below - or preserve it in the freezer for future use.

Freezing: intermediate steps need a lot of space per dough, so you don't 
need to freeze all doughs at once. A few at a time is fine. Place each bowl 
directly in the freezer, trying to keep the plate on top of the bowl, to prevent 
the dough drying while it freezes. After an hour or two, remove the frozen 
dough from the bowl - this will hopefully be easy if using the suggested 
flexible bowl. Put the dough into a sandwich bag quickly, before the edges start
to soften, and put the sandwich bag back into the freezer.

### Pizza

#### Equipment

- Chopping boards and knives.
- A blending wand.
- A large flat implement dusted with flour. E.g. a chopping board or pizza 
  paddle. For pressing the dough.
- A wooden spatula or pizza paddle. For moving the pizza within the oven.
- If defrosting doughs:
  - 1 small plate per dough, heavily dusted with flour.
  - 1 bowl per dough. To cover the plate.
- Cooking appliance options:
  - A domestic oven at maximum heat, with a refractory stone pre-heating inside.
  - A counter-top pizza oven.
  - A wood-fired or gas-fired pizza oven.

I have used all of the above cooking options at different times. The domestic 
oven works well, although it can be difficult to get the dough to bubble at 
these temperatures. The fired pizza oven is great for the theatre and sense of 
occasion, but is a lot more effort to work with - you need space 
inside/outside, you might need to cook outside, and wood fuelling requires 
its own expertise. My preferred compromise is a counter-top electric oven (I 
currently use a G3 Ferrari) - it achieves the temperatures required for bubbling
the base, and is very easy to work with, albeit there is no wood smoke in 
the flavour, and it takes 4mins per pizza instead of the 90secs of an 
authentic fired pizza. 

#### Ingredients

- 3 doughs (see above recipe).
- 1 tin of tomatoes.
- 1 ball of mozzarella.
- 1 handful of shaved parmesan.
- Basil
- Extra virgin olive oil or chilli oil.
- Other toppings of choice - but keep it light!
- Martin's favourite combo:
  - Iberico/Serrano ham.
  - Sweet drop peppers.
  - Cracked black peppercorns.
- For garlic bread, mix the below together:
  - 3 crushed cloves of garlic.
  - 1 tablespoon of butter/spread.
  - 1 teaspoon of parsley.

##### Note on quality

If you're feeling special you could get:

- A tin of San Marzano tomatoes.
- A ball of DOP buffalo mozzarella.
- Fresh basil straight off the plant.

You will notice the difference. But if you're doing this every week, 'normal 
quality' tomatoes and mozzarella, plus dried basil, still makes for a tasty 
pizza but with lower expense and lower effort. I tend to save the special 
stuff for parties.

#### Method

##### Prepare toppings

Blend the tin of tomatoes; most blending wands fit straight into the tin, or 
you can use some other receptical; make sure you have a spoon ready for 
applying your new passata to the pizza. Chop/grate all your other toppings 
_before_ doing anything with the dough.

##### Stretch the dough

Place the dough on the large floured implement. Press it flat, starting in the 
middle and working outwards. Flip over and do the same on the other side to 
get it a little thinner. If the dough is weak - not very elastic and likely 
to pull apart - then this is as much stretching as is safe; you can try to pull 
it a little thinner, but don't let it leave the surface it is resting on. 
But ideally the dough will be nice and strong, in which case: pick the flattened 
dough up and rest it on your knuckles (these are smoother than your finger 
tips), then stretch it outwards until you can see a some light passing 
through it. You can try spinning the dough in the air if it seems strong 
enough!

##### Make the pizza

Bring the refractory stone out of the domestic oven if applicable.

If you are using a refractory stone, or the right sort of counter-top oven, 
you can get a better quality base by adding toppings while the base is 
already cooking. Fired ovens do not permit this since the stone is in a 
covered chamber. Either way you should work quickly, before the base absorbs 
the flour dusting and starts to stick.

So, if you can (see above): transfer the pizza base onto the cooking stone 
by sliding it off its current surface; you may need to agitate/wiggle the 
surface slightly to get the base moving. Otherwise: leave the pizza base on the 
flat surface you pressed it on.

Apply the tomato passata with the back of spoon, thin enough that you can 
still see the base 50% of the time. Tear small chunks of mozzarella onto the 
passata, then sprinkle parmesan; **be sparing** with all of these -
a light pizza is a good pizza. Add any other toppings you like. Drizzle a 
small amount of oil on top.

##### Cook the pizza

Either:

- Put the refractory stone, with the pizza on it, back into the oven (top 
  shelf).
- Close the counter-top oven with the pizza inside it.
- Slide the pizza from its flat surface onto the cooking stone within the 
  oven; you may need to agitate/wiggle the surface slightly to get the pizza 
  moving.

In a domestic oven, cooking could take up to 10mins. Keep an eye on it but 
no intervention is needed. In a fired oven, cooking takes just 90secs, and 
you should rotate the pizza half way through. Counter-top ovens will be 
somewhere between these two times, and may also require the pizza to be 
rotated during.

Rotating the pizza: there are fancy implements for this, but I often find 
it's easiest to bring the pizza out of the oven and rotate it 180 degrees with 
your fingers.

##### Eat the pizza

Remove the pizza from the oven once the base has browned slightly. Sprinkle 
any leaf ingredients such as basil or rocket. Enjoy!
