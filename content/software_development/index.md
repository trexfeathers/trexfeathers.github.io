## Software Development

I'm a self-taught programmer, having started with simple VBA enhancements in 
MS Office. Software is now my full time vocation; I have so far worked 
full-time in three very different languages: DAX, SQL, and most recently Python.

I'm particularly impressed with the pragmatism around Python - the priority is
ease of understanding, and this has grown an enormous community of contributors.
This powerful community has produced libraries which enable writing in Python 
while passing execution to more difficult language(s) where better performance 
is available (e.g. [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) calling C). The best of both 
worlds!

SQL has given me a useful grounding for scientific Python:
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is heavily inspired by SQL, while the
execution plans in [Dask](https://dask.org/) have parallels with SQL's query
planning.
