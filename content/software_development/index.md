## Software Development

I'm a self-taught programmer, having started with simple VBA enhancements in 
MS Office. Software is now my career; I have so far worked 
full-time in three very different languages: DAX, SQL, and most recently Python.

I'm a big believer in open source software - [you can check out a lot of my work
on GitHub](https://github.com/trexfeathers).

Below you can read more about my professional experiences, personal projects,
or even check out my CV.
