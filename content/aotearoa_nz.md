## Holiday in Aotearoa New Zealand

Jemma and I shared a lot of new experiences on our trip to NZ, so I thought 
it would be nice to share some here...

### Flying long haul

It was literal decades since either of us had done a long haul flight, but 
we had to handle 4 of them on this trip - Auckland via San Francisco.

#### The good

- Airlines are good at keeping you happy, with lots of entertainment options 
  and regular meals, all bundled into the ticket price.
- Flights arriving early in the morning meant we could just sleep as much 
  as possible in-flight then start the day 'as normal'.

#### The not so good

- 12 hours x2 is a long time to be mostly seated!
- US customs was as slow as everyone warned us about, making transfer times 
  stressful.
- Getting through all the steps at an airport (check-in, security, etc.) 
  without incident takes practice, and we were un-practised.

### Culture

### Road trip

#### The good

- NZ's roads are so much better quality than the UK's.
- Major bends had suggested speed signs, which is great when every road is a 
  new road to you.
- The landscape meant almost every road was interesting to drive and 
  interesting to look at.

#### The not so good

- Seeing as many sights as possible in 3 weeks meant a lot of time on the 
  road - the car recorded 63 hours.
- Our rental insurance didn't cover us for gravel ('unsealed') roads, which 
  is actually quite a lot of roads in NZ.
- Driving at the speed limit got us tailgated, honked, and even brake-checked 
  once.
