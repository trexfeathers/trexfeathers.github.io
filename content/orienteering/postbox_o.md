## Across-Devon postbox orienteering

How many of Devon's postboxes can you visit in the time limit?

- `+20` points for each unique postbox you visit.
- `-10` point penalty for each minute you are late (1 second over counts as 
  a new minute).
- You choose which postbox to start at, **and you must finish at the same 
  postbox**.
- Two competitions:
  - 🏃 On foot - 1 hour time limit
  - 🚴 On bicycle - 3 hour time limit

### Ideas

- Strive for the highest score (against others or yourself), trying different 
  start locations / routes each time.
- Spice up your routine exercise with a new start location each week.
- Pick an interesting start location / map section and challenge your friends.

### Sound good? Let's go!

1. [Browse this map](https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/1oC7)
to choose an area you'd like to navigate round for 60 minutes.
2. Print a map of your chosen area, including the postboxes, using
[OpenOrienteeringMap](https://oomap.co.uk/gb/#/new/streeto/13/-3.5367/50.7212/)
(a guide is below).
3. Open the course on your phone, using
[the MapRun app](https://maprunners.weebly.com/):
   - `Select Event > UK > Devon > Devon Postboxes ON FOOT`
   - `Select Event > UK > Devon > Devon Postboxes ON BICYCLE`
   - Ignore the start location you see when you press `Go to Start` - you can 
     start at any postbox you like!
