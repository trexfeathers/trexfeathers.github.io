## Postbox orienteering

_**Currently in the experimental phase**_

### The format

A standard Queensland score:

- 60 minute time limit.
- `+20` points for each control you visit.
- `-10` point penalty for each minute you are late (`60:01` counts as a minute 
late).

### The twist

- **The area is way too big!** All the postboxes in Devon.
- **You can start anywhere!** Start-choice adds a new layer above 
control-choice and route-choice.

### Ideas

- Strive for the highest score (against others or yourself), trying different 
  start locations / routes each time.
- Spice up your routine exercise with a new start location each week.
- Pick an interesting start location / map section and challenge your friends.

### How it works

#### Choose your controls

[Browse this map](https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/1ogb)
to choose an area you'd like to navigate round for 60 minutes.

Things to consider:

- **You must finish at the same control as you started at.**
- Look out for locations that have multiple postboxes. They are separate on 
the map, if you look closely, and each one is worth `20` points.
- You are viewing the latest data from OpenStreetMap. The MapRun course was
created on 27/11/2022. Some postboxes may have been added/removed since, but
this is hopefully a rare occurrence.

#### Create your map

1. [Visit OpenOrienteeringMap UK](https://oomap.co.uk/gb/#/new/streeto/13/-3.5367/50.7212/).
2. Select the centre point for your printed map by clicking a point on the 
displayed map.
3. Select your desired scale and paper settings in the top menu.
4. You can re-centre the map if you need:
   1. Click the existing centre point until it displays as green.
   2. Click-and-drag the green point to the new centre location.
   3. Clicking elsewhere on the map with deactivate this mode (point goes blue).
5. Click the `Postboxes` button in the top menu. Your map should now be 
populated with all the postbox sites within its boundaries.
6. OPTIONAL: Edit the details in the 'control description' section on the right
(the auto-generated scores have no significance).
7. Click `Save & get PDF map` in the top-right.
8. Print the PDF.

#### Set up MapRun

_# TODO: use [MapRunLink](https://maprunners.weebly.com/maprunlink.html)_

1. Open your MapRun app (needs to be MapRun 6 or later).
2. Open the 'hamburger menu' in the bottom-right.
3. Select `CheckSites`.
4. Enter the code: `014769`, then select `OK`.
5. Select `Options and Settings`, then activate `Start Anywhere (SAW)`, then 
come back out of the settings menu.

#### Start your run

1. Select `Go to Start`.
2. When you first open the map, the Start/Finish location you see is irrelevant.
3. Proceed to your chosen first control.
4. The time starts once the first control is punched.
5. **Remember that you must also finish at your first control.**
6. Enjoy!
